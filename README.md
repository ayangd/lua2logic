# lua2logic
A lua to Mindustry logic text (a.k.a AnukeScript); The text where you get when copying from Mindustry microprocessors.  
This tool is inspired by [c2logic](https://github.com/SuperStormer/c2logic).  
This tool is fresh and in alpha state, so expect some hiccups.

## Dependencies

## Usage

The output will be on the screen (`stdout`).
