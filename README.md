# lua2logic
A lua to Mindustry logic text (a.k.a AnukeScript); The text where you get when copying from Mindustry microprocessors.  
This tool is inspired by [c2logic](https://github.com/SuperStormer/c2logic).  
This tool is fresh and in alpha state, so expect some hiccups.

> Note that this project is discontinued due to:
> 1. I see no point continuing this project anymore, as variable operations are always treated as `double`, or `int` if it's bitwise (and a bunch of limitations).
> 2. My code is just messy. I can easily clear that, but back to reason 1.
> 
> If you really want me to continue this, maybe try to pursuade me. I'll make a new project after this.
